# Punctuation
Punctuation restoration using TensorFlow

## Introduction
The repository was inspired by **[github.com/ottokart/punctuator2](https://github.com/ottokart/punctuator2)**. I did not want to use *phyton* in serving the model. So I tried  to change the *Theano* to *TensorFlow*. **Attention** and **Late Fusion** were the big challanges for me, I'm not sure they are 100% correct. I compared the results with **punctuator2** and they looked very similar.
